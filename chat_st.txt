10/20/21, 10:06 PM - ST: He makes his fight choreography videos on animes and things like that. That's why I'm sure many people are saying that Shang chi has legendary fight scenes 😂😂

10/20/21, 10:06 PM - ST: It's like an anime😂
10/20/21, 10:07 PM - ST: He was also Chadwick bosemans stunt double in captain America civil war
10/20/21, 10:07 PM - ST: Ahh yes yes. But there could not really be strategy since everyone wws trying to survive
10/20/21, 10:07 PM - ST: Realistically I would have done the same thing as them
10/21/21, 9:01 AM - Babila Mutia: okay okay 😹😹
10/21/21, 9:01 AM - Babila Mutia: No but they could have chosen games that were more strategic n'a?
10/21/21, 9:01 AM - Babila Mutia: like how the tug of war was
10/21/21, 9:01 AM - Babila Mutia: or the bridge game

10/21/21, 12:11 PM - ST: Ahh😂
10/21/21, 12:12 PM - ST: But I'm sure they went for more games that would put people under pressure than trying to make it more strategic
10/21/21, 12:12 PM - Babila Mutia: You see na
10/21/21, 12:12 PM - Babila Mutia: but it can still put people Unger pressure when it's tactical n'a
10/21/21, 12:12 PM - Babila Mutia: Like those two games also had pressure
10/21/21, 12:12 PM - ST: Like games that could make the audience feel afraid for the characters or something. Like you're afraid because you don't know who will survive 😂
10/21/21, 12:13 PM - Babila Mutia: But that's how the bridge game was ☹️
10/21/21, 12:13 PM - ST: No not really eh
10/21/21, 12:13 PM - ST: Because they have a plan na or something. So they might survive
10/21/21, 12:13 PM - ST: The bridge game did not really have much strategy eh. It was really just every man for himself 😂😂
10/21/21, 12:13 PM - ST: Then they started pushing people 😂
10/21/21, 12:14 PM - Babila Mutia: But it was more tactical than the honeycomb game
10/21/21, 12:14 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹😹
10/21/21, 12:14 PM - ST: Yes. But I can say the most tactical game was the tug o war game 😂
10/21/21, 12:15 PM - ST: The bridge game. They just started pushing people 😂😂
10/21/21, 12:15 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹😹😹
10/21/21, 12:15 PM - ST: Then at the end that intelligent man pushed the man that was looking at the glass 😂😂😂
10/21/21, 12:15 PM - ST: It was just terrible😂
10/21/21, 12:15 PM - ST: Then that other man who was refusing to move ahead 😂
10/21/21, 12:15 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹😹😹😹
10/21/21, 12:16 PM - Babila Mutia: But they could have just moved on the rails na
10/21/21, 12:16 PM - ST: No the glass was on top of the rails 😂😂
10/21/21, 12:16 PM - ST: Go and waghc it again 😂
10/21/21, 12:16 PM - ST: Even me I was asking myself the same question 😂
10/21/21, 12:16 PM - Babila Mutia: But even still they could move on the rails na
10/21/21, 12:17 PM - Babila Mutia: Put on leg on each rail and be moving
10/21/21, 12:17 PM - Babila Mutia: Even if the glass is there
10/21/21, 12:17 PM - ST: And the glass was large again na😂
10/21/21, 12:17 PM - ST: They will have to strerch their legs or something 😂😂
10/21/21, 12:17 PM - ST: Then there was that  time limit
10/21/21, 12:18 PM - Babila Mutia: But the distance between the in between rails was smaller than the one between the glass
10/21/21, 12:18 PM - ST: And the glass was breaking again 😂😂
10/21/21, 12:18 PM - Babila Mutia: But it will nt break if they walk on the rails
10/21/21, 12:18 PM - ST: Ahh😂😂😂
10/21/21, 12:18 PM - Babila Mutia: They could have done it and won
10/21/21, 12:18 PM - ST: But they didn't want to try it na. Imagine if you are in that game under tension you might not even think of that 😂😂😂
10/21/21, 12:19 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹
10/21/21, 12:19 PM - Babila Mutia: Then in the Marbles game, they could have just exchanged marbles
10/21/21, 12:19 PM - Babila Mutia: And both people will win
10/21/21, 12:38 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂wait how?
10/21/21, 12:38 PM - ST: I don't understand?😂
10/21/21, 12:40 PM - Babila Mutia: The rule was "Any person that succeeds to get all of his partner's marbles has won"
10/21/21, 12:40 PM - Babila Mutia: So if they exchanged all their marbles
10/21/21, 12:40 PM - Babila Mutia: Each person would have had all of their partner's marbles
10/21/21, 12:41 PM - Babila Mutia: and both people win
10/21/21, 12:59 PM - ST: Ahh😂😂😂

10/23/21, 6:04 PM - Babila Mutia: So you go question by question...

If you read a question and you know you can do it in less than one minute you do it, if not skip it.

Until you reach the end
10/23/21, 6:04 PM - ST: Yes I did that. The questions which required a lot of thinking I skipped them and went to the ones that I could answer outright
10/23/21, 6:05 PM - Babila Mutia: That way you save some time

11/10/21, 3:51 PM - Babila Mutia: what is he saying about the scenes?
11/10/21, 3:52 PM - ST: He is just talking about the symbolism in different scenes. For example when killmonger is arrested and brought to the throne room and the camera pans upside down it is a symbolism and reference to Wakanda turning upside down because of killmonger taking over
11/10/21, 3:53 PM - ST: Like his arrival will turn the whole of Wakanda upside-down
11/10/21, 3:55 PM - ST: And other scenes that subconsciously make you feel different emotions. Like when killmonger and tchalla are fighting at the waterfall and the camera angle is shown from above, subconsciously adds a feeling of worry or anxiety because you are like "What is going to happen?"
11/10/21, 4:05 PM - Babila Mutia: 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾

11/17/21, 1:11 PM - Babila Mutia: The thing is that when u have many characters you can only focus on few, because for each character the audience has to understand their state of mind, and motivation and all those kinds of things
11/17/21, 1:11 PM - Babila Mutia: If not it will be like people are doing things for no reason and the movie will be like Venom 2

12/7/21, 9:41 AM - Babila Mutia: yes
12/7/21, 9:41 AM - Babila Mutia: okay let me look at it
12/7/21, 9:43 AM - Babila Mutia: here you've not put numTails++ 😹
12/7/21, 9:43 AM - Babila Mutia: I think that's the only problem
12/7/21, 9:43 AM - Babila Mutia: is this Java or Javascript? 😹
12/7/21, 9:43 AM - Babila Mutia: it's Java n'a? 😹
12/7/21, 9:47 AM - Babila Mutia: the percentage that the teacher is asking is this:

For the percentage of heads:

(num_heads/(num_heads + num_tails)) * 100

And that is just the same as num_heads since you flipped 100 coins (num_heads + num_tails = 100)
12/7/21, 9:47 AM - Babila Mutia: same thing for num_tails
12/7/21, 9:48 AM - Babila Mutia: For the percentage of tails:

(num_tails/(num_heads + num_tails)) * 100

And that is just the same as num_heads since you flipped 100 coins (num_heads + num_tails = 100)
12/7/21, 12:39 PM - ST: No for that I actually tried removing numheads++ and numtails++ to see if I could add any something else there. Maybe a method
12/7/21, 12:40 PM - ST: I sent this picture when I was typing numTails++ back😂😂
12/7/21, 12:40 PM - ST: Yes Java
12/7/21, 12:40 PM - ST: There's a difference between Java and Javascript?😂😂
12/7/21, 12:41 PM - ST: Ahhh...🤔🤔🤔
12/7/21, 12:41 PM - ST: Yes yes it makes sense🤔🤔
12/7/21, 1:12 PM - Babila Mutia: yes yes 😹😹

12/7/21, 1:55 PM - Babila Mutia: okay okay
12/7/21, 1:56 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹okay
12/7/21, 1:56 PM - Babila Mutia: When u had numTails++ was it giving you the correct number of Tails?
12/7/21, 1:56 PM - ST: Yes it was
12/7/21, 1:57 PM - Babila Mutia: Okay okay
12/7/21, 2:47 PM - ST: nope it didn't work
12/7/21, 2:47 PM - ST: It still displayed the same number heads and tails displayed
12/7/21, 2:48 PM - Babila Mutia: yes that's the percentage
12/7/21, 2:48 PM - Babila Mutia: The if you flip 50 coins for example and use that formula it will be different from the actual number
12/7/21, 2:49 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
12/7/21, 2:50 PM - Babila Mutia: ahnn
12/7/21, 2:50 PM - Babila Mutia: Then just use the formula and don't multiply by 100 at the end
12/7/21, 2:50 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
12/7/21, 2:50 PM - Babila Mutia: just don't multiply
12/7/21, 2:50 PM - ST: Ahh ok
12/7/21, 2:52 PM - ST: It still gave the same result
12/7/21, 2:52 PM - ST: Normally if I divide the results by a 100 it should give the percentage
12/7/21, 2:52 PM - Babila Mutia: You used this formula?
12/7/21, 2:52 PM - ST: Yes
12/7/21, 2:53 PM - Babila Mutia: the one ontop eh
12/7/21, 2:53 PM - Babila Mutia: let me see abit
12/7/21, 2:53 PM - ST: Yes that's what I used
12/7/21, 2:53 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
12/7/21, 2:53 PM - ST: I removed the 100
12/7/21, 2:54 PM - Babila Mutia: it's what you're printing 😹
12/7/21, 2:54 PM - Babila Mutia: You're still printing the numbers down
12/7/21, 2:54 PM - ST: How?😂
12/7/21, 2:54 PM - ST: I dknt understand
12/7/21, 2:54 PM - Babila Mutia: After you calculate the percentages, you print the wrong variables
12/7/21, 2:54 PM - Babila Mutia: <Media omitted>
12/7/21, 2:55 PM - ST: Ahhh🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
12/7/21, 2:55 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
12/7/21, 2:55 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹
12/7/21, 2:56 PM - ST: It gives 0
12/7/21, 2:56 PM - ST: 0.0
12/7/21, 2:57 PM - ST: I've tried with both times 100 and without
12/7/21, 2:57 PM - Babila Mutia: it's a thing with Java.
12/7/21, 2:57 PM - Babila Mutia: when you divide two ints and it's less than 1,the answer is automatically zero
12/7/21, 2:58 PM - ST: So should I make numheads and numtails doubles?
12/7/21, 2:58 PM - Babila Mutia: yes that should work
12/7/21, 3:00 PM - ST: It almost did... But the percentages it displayed were not equal to 1
12/7/21, 3:00 PM - ST: Which is equivalent to 100
12/7/21, 3:01 PM - ST: They were decimals but were not equal to 1
12/7/21, 3:01 PM - Babila Mutia: Yeah that's okay n'a
12/7/21, 3:01 PM - Babila Mutia: up here they are not equal to one n'a
12/7/21, 3:01 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
12/7/21, 3:01 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹
12/7/21, 3:02 PM - ST: There is a program which checks the answer
12/7/21, 3:02 PM - Babila Mutia: what are the decimals you have?
12/7/21, 3:02 PM - ST: So as so far as what I have is not the same as what the program gives as the answer then it's wrong
12/7/21, 3:02 PM - ST: Heads is 0.5 and tails is 0.55
12/7/21, 3:03 PM - ST: I changed numheads and numtails to doubles
12/7/21, 3:03 PM - Babila Mutia: look at how you calculate PercHeads
12/7/21, 3:03 PM - Babila Mutia: there's a mistake in the denominator
12/7/21, 3:03 PM - Babila Mutia: you add the number of heads to itself instead of adding it to the number of Tails
12/7/21, 3:04 PM - ST: I've tried it.. It's correct now but.....😂😂 Numheads and numtails are now doubles
12/7/21, 3:04 PM - ST: And they have to be integers
12/7/21, 3:05 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹Okay just copy them to different variables
12/7/21, 3:05 PM - Babila Mutia: so numHeadsDouble and numTailsDouble
12/7/21, 3:05 PM - Babila Mutia: and keep numHeads and numTails as integers
12/7/21, 3:06 PM - Babila Mutia: that way you print them as integers and use the double values to calculate the percentages
12/7/21, 3:09 PM - ST: Yes it worked
12/7/21, 3:09 PM - Babila Mutia: okay 👌🏾
12/7/21, 3:09 PM - ST: I also had to put numheadsdouble and numtails doubles ++
12/7/21, 3:09 PM - ST: For it to work
12/7/21, 3:09 PM - Babila Mutia: Well you could just copy them _after_ flipping all the coins
12/7/21, 3:09 PM - Babila Mutia: so you just before you print
12/7/21, 3:10 PM - Babila Mutia: that way you don't have to do this
12/7/21, 3:10 PM - ST: Ahh yes yes that's true 🤔
12/7/21, 3:10 PM - ST: Lemme Try it
12/7/21, 3:10 PM - Babila Mutia: okay
12/7/21, 3:11 PM - Babila Mutia: just do:
numTails Double = (double)numTails:
12/7/21, 3:11 PM - Babila Mutia: that should convert it
12/7/21, 3:11 PM - Babila Mutia: and also for heads
12/7/21, 3:20 PM - ST: This is casting na🤔
12/7/21, 3:20 PM - Babila Mutia: yes yes
12/7/21, 3:20 PM - ST: Ok
12/7/21, 3:21 PM - ST: Ahh ok
12/7/21, 3:41 PM - Babila Mutia: yes 😹 that's why I use it for all coding challenges

12/7/21, 3:48 PM - ST: It's terrible. When I finished my code and looked at it, it looked like a child had just been playing with numbers 🤦🏾‍♂️😂😂😂
12/7/21, 3:48 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹😹😹😹that's why pple sometimes don't like Java
12/7/21, 3:49 PM - Babila Mutia: Did but it's good to learn object oriented programming

12/14/21, 2:21 PM - ST: This movie is going to be more hype than endgame
12/14/21, 2:23 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹 no no
12/14/21, 2:23 PM - Babila Mutia: I dnt think so
12/14/21, 2:23 PM - Babila Mutia: endgame was about Thanos 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾
12/14/21, 2:47 PM - ST: And they just butchered his character 🤦🏾‍♂️
12/14/21, 2:47 PM - ST: In endgame he wasn't the old experienced Titan seeking salvation for the universe
12/14/21, 2:47 PM - ST: He was a blood thirsty maniac who wanted to kill everyone
12/14/21, 2:48 PM - ST: His endgame portrayal was more comic accurate but we wanted the same Thanos as before
12/14/21, 2:49 PM - ST: In endgame he was still young and angry and he treated everyone as an enemy rather than how in infinity war he treated them like stubborn children thag could not understand his grand vision 🤌🏾🔥
12/14/21, 2:50 PM - ST: So I mostly think endgame was about the avengers mostly and the end of their character arcs.. Meanwhile infinity war was about Thanos
12/14/21, 2:50 PM - ST: It was his movie. But endgame was more of an avengers movie and everything it was about their family and the end of their adventure.. And Tony's sacrifice to save the universe...🤌🏾🔥
12/14/21, 2:51 PM - ST: Are you seeing I'm  a film analyst 😂😂🤌🏾
12/14/21, 4:05 PM - Babila Mutia: Ha ah 😹😹
12/14/21, 4:06 PM - Babila Mutia: It's just 4rm different YouTube break downs that you've also watched n'a
12/14/21, 4:06 PM - Babila Mutia: BUT endgame was hype bc of Thanos
12/14/21, 4:06 PM - Babila Mutia: If there was no other villain there and they were just travelling back in time, it would nt have been hype
12/14/21, 4:48 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
12/14/21, 4:49 PM - ST: I don't even watch most of these channels like emergency awesome and so on
12/14/21, 4:49 PM - ST: I don't even like them
12/14/21, 4:49 PM - ST: I came to 4th dimensional understanding of the movie 😂🤌🏾
12/14/21, 4:50 PM - ST: But they should have made it in such a way that it was a recent version of Thanos that came to the future
12/14/21, 4:50 PM - ST: Not an old one. Because when he was young he was still vicious or something
12/14/21, 6:28 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹
12/14/21, 6:28 PM - Babila Mutia: No no
12/14/21, 6:29 PM - Babila Mutia: it instead would not have made sense
12/14/21, 6:29 PM - Babila Mutia: to me it was okay
12/14/21, 6:29 PM - Babila Mutia: if it was an older version it would. feel like. we were rewatching infinity war and it would be boring
12/14/21, 6:29 PM - Babila Mutia: The younger made it feel. different
12/14/21, 7:08 PM - ST: Yes that's true. But people were coming to watch endgame because of Thanos na, because they liked him so that would mean they wanted the infinity war version of him. True it was diffierent but that wasn't the reason why people were coming back to see him. They were coming to see him because he was a good villain in the previous movie and they wanted more of him
12/14/21, 7:08 PM - ST: But anyways
12/14/21, 7:08 PM - ST: It was still nice
12/14/21, 10:14 PM - Babila Mutia: <Media omitted>

12/23/21, 6:01 PM - ST: Ahh... Okay
12/23/21, 6:01 PM - ST: I feel like open world games are just becoming worse and worse
12/23/21, 6:02 PM - ST: They put a big world with too many things to do
12/23/21, 6:02 PM - ST: I just want to play a nice game with a nice story
12/23/21, 6:02 PM - Babila Mutia: and the things are nt interesting
12/23/21, 6:02 PM - Babila Mutia: I'm telling you
12/23/21, 6:02 PM - ST: Yes yes
12/23/21, 6:02 PM - Babila Mutia: Like Last of Us or red dead redemption
12/23/21, 6:02 PM - ST: And this is something that naughty dog does very well. With games like uncharted and last of us
12/23/21, 6:02 PM - ST: Yes yes
12/23/21, 6:03 PM - ST: Rockstar is the only one that really makes nice open world games
12/23/21, 6:03 PM - ST: Because they pay attention to detail
12/23/21, 6:03 PM - ST: Like I remember that I downloaded devil may cry 5 and I played it from start to finish
12/23/21, 6:03 PM - ST: Because it was very nice
12/23/21, 6:30 PM - Babila Mutia: Yes that's why they have the best single player games
12/23/21, 6:30 PM - Babila Mutia: yes
12/23/21, 6:31 PM - Babila Mutia: I think an open world game can only work if it's on the old days
12/23/21, 6:31 PM - Babila Mutia: like Witcher 3 or Breath of the wild
12/23/21, 7:34 PM - ST: Yes yes
12/23/21, 7:34 PM - ST: Yes. But with the Unreal engine 5 it could be possible to make a good open world game in th future
12/23/21, 7:47 PM - Babila Mutia: It's nt about that
12/23/21, 7:48 PM - Babila Mutia: It's that for an olden day game it's nt complicated
12/23/21, 7:48 PM - Babila Mutia: look at Witcher
12/23/21, 7:48 PM - Babila Mutia: u can enter every houses bc there are few houses
12/23/21, 7:48 PM - Babila Mutia: and there were less people in  a city and all that
12/23/21, 7:49 PM - Babila Mutia: but to achieve that same kind of behavior in a modern age game is. complicated bc in the same size of a map there are much more people. to. simulate.
12/23/21, 7:49 PM - Babila Mutia: Much more possible activities
12/23/21, 7:49 PM - Babila Mutia: and buildings are much bigger so making all of them with interiors is hard. And how can u make all the parts of the map. interesting?
12/23/21, 7:49 PM - Babila Mutia: that's why
12/23/21, 9:21 PM - ST: Ahh yes yes
12/23/21, 9:21 PM - ST: Ahh yes that's true because even for assassin's creed origins you could enter almost every house
12/23/21, 9:22 PM - Babila Mutia: Yes yes
12/23/21, 9:22 PM - Babila Mutia: that's why I don't think modern open world games can be really nice.

12/24/21, 12:22 AM - Babila Mutia: I was thinking that since it's the same director atleast it will le live up to the previous ones
12/24/21, 12:23 AM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹
12/24/21, 12:23 AM - ST: It was the same director?
12/24/21, 12:23 AM - ST: Then why wws the film horrible
12/24/21, 12:23 AM - Babila Mutia: Well it was two sisters that made the original trilogy
12/24/21, 12:23 AM - Babila Mutia: then one of them made this one
12/24/21, 12:24 AM - Babila Mutia: like the Russo Brothers n'a
12/24/21, 12:27 AM - ST: Ahhh
12/24/21, 12:27 AM - ST: Yes yes
12/24/21, 12:28 AM - ST: Maybe the "people in suits" did not like the original thing that the sisters created and decided to water it down to the version that was released
12/24/21, 12:28 AM - Babila Mutia: that's also true 😹
12/24/21, 12:28 AM - Babila Mutia: <Media omitted>
12/24/21, 1:46 AM - ST: Ahh yes yes. I remember that part I liked that section a little bit but I felt like the movie was too reliant on technological factors and things like that
12/24/21, 1:48 AM - ST: <Media omitted>
12/24/21, 8:09 PM - Babila Mutia: it's terrible
12/24/21, 8:09 PM - Babila Mutia: and they did nt even add anything new
12/24/21, 8:10 PM - Babila Mutia: or what was new was nt having the same nature as the old one

12/29/21, 3:58 PM - ST: Baba Voss was somehow against it at one point
12/29/21, 3:58 PM - ST: Because he accepted that the twins should start using the box when his wife didn't know about it
12/29/21, 4:08 PM - Babila Mutia: Really

12/29/21, 4:11 PM - ST: What does it mean?🌚
12/29/21, 4:18 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹
12/29/21, 4:20 PM - Babila Mutia: That there is always a manufacturing process for a product that reduces its cost to be extremely close to the cost of its raw materials and any extra license you need to buy
12/29/21, 4:36 PM - ST: Ahh so In total you are not actually gaining anything of it reaches the cost of the other things na
12/29/21, 4:36 PM - ST: That's why people put interest on goods?
12/29/21, 4:39 PM - Babila Mutia: Well instead u want to reduce it as much as possible
12/29/21, 4:39 PM - Babila Mutia: Usually the cost to make something is greater than that sum that is here
12/29/21, 4:39 PM - Babila Mutia: like paying people for manufacturing
12/29/21, 4:39 PM - Babila Mutia: so if you can eleminate humans in the manufacturing process you reduce the cost
12/29/21, 4:40 PM - Babila Mutia: ideally is should be equal to that minimal cost that he described
12/29/21, 4:44 PM - ST: Ahhh ok ok. That makes sense 🤔
12/29/21, 4:44 PM - Babila Mutia: Yeah
12/29/21, 4:45 PM - Babila Mutia: that's why it's asymptomatical...
because the extra cost never dissappears
12/29/21, 4:45 PM - ST: Ok. I understand. So why did Elon musk not just explain it like that. Why did he have to make a complicated saying 🌚
12/29/21, 4:46 PM - Babila Mutia: It's shorter n'a.. Look how  long my explanation here was. The words allowed to say all that in short but still specific way

1/26/22, 3:02 PM - Babila Mutia: noo it's the MCU 🤌🏾🤌🏾
1/26/22, 3:02 PM - ST: And it's probably still in English but with French subtitles🤔
1/26/22, 3:02 PM - ST: I don't think they have dub out yet
1/26/22, 3:02 PM - Babila Mutia: no. no. it's nt. When it's like that they show it on the schedule
1/26/22, 3:02 PM - Babila Mutia: it's out. Normally when they show in English there are always subtitles. Then when they out French it's just in French
1/26/22, 3:03 PM - ST: That's what I'm saying na, because in China it was in English but with French subtitles. So it's probably in English but on the French schedule because it has French subtitles na or something
1/26/22, 3:03 PM - ST: But with Chinese subtitles sorry
1/26/22, 3:03 PM - ST: Eh?
1/26/22, 3:04 PM - Babila Mutia: Okay. But I'm not sure

Because they have two tags
there's VF: Version Française
And VOSTFR: Version Originale Sous Titres Français
1/26/22, 3:04 PM - Babila Mutia: so when they out VOSTFR I know. it's in English
1/26/22, 3:04 PM - ST: You can waghc that one na🌚

1/31/22, 6:03 AM - Babila Mutia: I dnt like when shows do time traveling bc they always make it wrong and there are alot of loopholes and it spoils it
1/31/22, 6:04 AM - Babila Mutia: the only one that did nt is Endgame
1/31/22, 7:03 AM - Babila Mutia: Why will Grisha say stop Eren and still give the attack Titan to eren?
1/31/22, 12:56 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1/31/22, 1:01 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
1/31/22, 1:11 PM - Babila Mutia: I know that he was seeing the memories.
1/31/22, 1:11 PM - Babila Mutia: no he could have given someone else
1/31/22, 1:12 PM - Babila Mutia: like Levi or Erwin
1/31/22, 1:12 PM - ST: He probably didn't know them na
1/31/22, 1:12 PM - ST: And by that time Levi wasn't part of the scouts
1/31/22, 1:13 PM - ST: And again grisha only trusted his son
1/31/22, 1:13 PM - Babila Mutia: no he was 😹😹😹😹
that was when the walls were broken...
1/31/22, 1:13 PM - Babila Mutia: Levi was already in the scouts
1/31/22, 1:13 PM - ST: Eh?😂
1/31/22, 1:13 PM - ST: Ahh yes yds
1/31/22, 1:13 PM - ST: Yes
1/31/22, 1:13 PM - Babila Mutia: yes...
1/31/22, 1:13 PM - Babila Mutia: ha ah 😹
he instead did nt trust him

Or was nt supposed to trust him since he told Zeke to  stop him
1/31/22, 1:14 PM - Babila Mutia: to me that's why it doesn't make sense
1/31/22, 1:14 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
1/31/22, 1:16 PM - Babila Mutia: no 😹...
1/31/22, 1:16 PM - Babila Mutia: Eren was not the only way he could do it
1/31/22, 1:17 PM - Babila Mutia: He managed to find the home of the king in the walls
1/31/22, 1:17 PM - Babila Mutia: that means he had enough intelligence on what was happening in the walls
1/31/22, 1:18 PM - Babila Mutia: to me it doesn't make sense to give Eren especially when you are _sure_ that u want to stop him.

For example if he gave to Levi he is not sure what will happen but with Eren he _sure_ that what will happen is something he doesn't want
1/31/22, 1:18 PM - Babila Mutia: so why will he give it to him
1/31/22, 1:18 PM - Babila Mutia: this is why I don't like when shows do time things...

It makes things a type
1/31/22, 1:22 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
1/31/22, 1:25 PM - Babila Mutia: To me it is not really making sense.

Like through out the anime every other thing really makes sense with the characters and all that. But here it's just a type...
1/31/22, 1:26 PM - Babila Mutia: But even still it's a type. It's like saying that if your traumatized you'll just see somebody who wants to kill. you and give him a gun
1/31/22, 1:26 PM - Babila Mutia: it's a type
1/31/22, 1:38 PM - ST: But that's different na. Eren wasn't a threat to grisha
1/31/22, 1:38 PM - ST: And I don't also see how that goes against grisha's character
1/31/22, 1:38 PM - Babila Mutia: But the whole thing still feels out of character.
1/31/22, 1:39 PM - ST: Ha ah how?😂😂
1/31/22, 1:40 PM - Babila Mutia: Because of all that I said n'a..
He's a doctor and he doesn't like suffering, but he'll just allow Eren to do all of that.

He's nt just allowing him, he's the one making him able to do it.

Its nt like Eren was also there to manipulate him to give the injection again.
1/31/22, 1:41 PM - ST: This same Dr was still following his mission and everything
1/31/22, 1:41 PM - ST: In Marley he was also still a Dr na
1/31/22, 1:41 PM - ST: But he still had the intention to take revenge and all of that
1/31/22, 1:41 PM - ST: Possibly kill people along the way
1/31/22, 1:42 PM - Babila Mutia: Then why did he hesitate to kill the children in the cave.

And if he was okay with it why did he ask Zeke to stop Eren.... 

no matter how you look at it there's an inconsistency somewhere
1/31/22, 1:43 PM - Babila Mutia: it's nt too big...
but it's nt like all the other things that have been happening in the series that make complete sense
1/31/22, 1:43 PM - ST: Because he probably didn't want to kill them...
1/31/22, 1:44 PM - ST: Ahh I don't know but to me it still makes sense
1/31/22, 1:44 PM - Babila Mutia: okay anyhow
2/1/22, 12:16 AM - Babila Mutia: <Media omitted>
2/1/22, 12:38 AM - ST: No he doesn't have all the memories of his future self
2/1/22, 12:39 AM - Babila Mutia: ahn okay
2/1/22, 12:39 AM - ST: Only a little glimpses. And it only happened when he kissed historia's hand
2/1/22, 12:39 AM - ST: Because there he got connected to the memory of him and zeke in his fathers memories
2/1/22, 12:39 AM - Babila Mutia: But he saw all. the memories at that point n'a
2/1/22, 12:40 AM - ST: How?
2/1/22, 12:40 AM - Babila Mutia: they show like a series of memories when he kisses her hand n'a
2/1/22, 12:40 AM - ST: Yes yes
2/1/22, 12:40 AM - Babila Mutia: I think even the memory with Kriger is there
2/1/22, 12:41 AM - ST: No no. He saw the memories with Kruger before he kissed her hand
2/1/22, 12:41 AM - Babila Mutia: ahn okay
2/1/22, 12:41 AM - ST: Those were his dad's memories
2/1/22, 12:41 AM - Babila Mutia: ahn okay
2/1/22, 12:41 AM - Babila Mutia: <Media omitted>
2/1/22, 12:41 AM - Babila Mutia: <Media omitted>
2/1/22, 12:42 AM - ST: I'm sure what happened is that the eren of the future probably withheld those memories in his father's memories. And then revealed them to him when he was in contact with royal blood
2/1/22, 12:44 AM - Babila Mutia: But those are not Erens memories they are his father's own...

And now that we dnt have any specific explanation of the exact attack Titan powers its start to be an excuse for everything. Like maybe the attack Titan had the power to do this and that.
2/1/22, 12:44 AM - ST: Because at both points were they interacted with his father both erens of both times were in contact with royal blood. Eren of the future in concact with zeke and eren of the past in contact with historia
2/1/22, 12:44 AM - Babila Mutia: <Media omitted>
2/1/22, 12:45 AM - ST: And another thing is that maybe the attack Titan doesn't actually have the power to do any of this. And eren was just sending memories back at the specific point he touched zeke. And the whole time the previous inheritors thought it was the attack titans power
2/1/22, 12:46 AM - Babila Mutia: that will even be better...
But you see why I'm saying the story now has too many holes..

Its nt complete... there's too many things that are left to speculation...
2/1/22, 12:47 AM - ST: Like eren at the point he touched zeke probably sent memories back to Kruger, then sent memories back to his previous self and all of that. Or to grisha, then the whole time the previous inheritors thought that that was the attack titans power
2/1/22, 12:47 AM - ST: Ahh yes... But to some degree it makes some sense
2/1/22, 12:47 AM - ST: If you don't think about it too much
2/1/22, 12:48 AM - ST: But even marvel has time plot holes
2/1/22, 12:48 AM - Babila Mutia: <Media omitted>
2/1/22, 12:49 AM - Babila Mutia: that's normal. for marvel n'a...
they haven't really had that reputation even in the comics of being extremely precise in lore and all that....
2/1/22, 12:50 AM - ST: I think maybe it actually had to do with adaptation eh. Because in the manga it was really clearly well explained
2/1/22, 12:50 AM - ST: That's why many manga readers grabbed the concepts quickly or something
2/1/22, 12:52 AM - Babila Mutia: no no but even when u explained it the issues I raised are still there n'a...

except if you have spoilers later on about the powers. I'll wait and watch.

But even when u explain how it's the memories from Eren that Grisha is seeing and all that, there's still alot that has to be speculated.
2/1/22, 12:52 AM - ST: Then you'll have to finish the show to understand everything 🌚

2/3/22, 1:24 PM - ST: Where it transfers energy from one ball to the other and in the end the middle balls don't even move. Only the end balls move
2/3/22, 1:24 PM - Babila Mutia: yes it's kind of like that
2/3/22, 1:24 PM - Babila Mutia: the force exerted when push an object is propagated through it like a wave
2/3/22, 1:26 PM - ST: So in the end only the molecules of that object move, but it happens so fast that it's like the whole object is moving?

3/23/22, 5:01 PM - ST: Like most of those plot twists you could put two and two together. But this one nobody saw it coming. And it wasn't also out of nowhere. There were past clues showing it but no one ever imagined it would link up to that
3/23/22, 5:01 PM - ST: Or like the episode called from you 2000 years into the future
3/23/22, 5:02 PM - ST: Which was linked to the first episode
3/23/22, 5:02 PM - ST: Which had the title to you 2000 years into the future

4/11/22, 2:09 PM - ST: Please what book is this?🤔
4/11/22, 2:10 PM - Babila Mutia: It's nt a book per se it just a summary of notes from the book
4/11/22, 2:10 PM - Babila Mutia: But it's from "12 rules for Life" by Jordan Peterson
4/11/22, 2:10 PM - Babila Mutia: I think you should read it
4/11/22, 2:10 PM - Babila Mutia: it's very good
4/11/22, 2:10 PM - Babila Mutia: You heard what happened on Saturday?

4/11/22, 2:11 PM - Babila Mutia: You're welcome
4/11/22, 2:11 PM - ST: Yes yes blossom told me about it. It's just really sad 😞
4/11/22, 2:11 PM - Babila Mutia: I'm telling you 🤦🏾‍♂️
4/11/22, 2:13 PM - ST: I just realized in the end that people sometimes crying about a death and the actions thereof tend to be selfish, because the person who is dead is in a better place and as Christians we do believe that. Secondly if that person were to see all the chaos happening would that person want that? So that means all those actions carried out are selfish but not out of selflessness or grief
4/11/22, 2:14 PM - ST: I've just been thinking about these things..
4/11/22, 2:14 PM - Babila Mutia: Even me..
4/11/22, 2:15 PM - Babila Mutia: I think it's selfish because we are sad because we won't get to see the person again
4/11/22, 2:15 PM - Babila Mutia: But it's okay to feel sad like that
4/11/22, 2:15 PM - Babila Mutia: it's when you do terrible things now that it's bad
4/11/22, 2:21 PM - ST: Yes that's true

4/19/22, 9:24 PM - Babila Mutia: okay
The action in the beginning is not too nice 😹

not ghat it's bad, but it's just normal

not like Daredevil
4/19/22, 9:24 PM - ST: It's the best batman movie 😂😂😂...
4/19/22, 9:25 PM - ST: It will get better don't mind 😂.. Even me I was saying that at the beginning 😂.. And also it wants to be realistic and grounded. Daredevil's suit was light fiber material. But the batman has a cape and his suit and equipment and everything but don't worry the fights will get way better 😂. Especially going towards the end
4/19/22, 9:25 PM - ST: And the batmobile chase scenes 😂😂😂😂🤌🤌🔥heeeh ehhh 😂
4/19/22, 9:25 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹 okay okay
4/19/22, 9:25 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹okay
4/19/22, 9:26 PM - Babila Mutia: I was wondering why he was using but a normal bike ever since
4/19/22, 9:27 PM - ST: Because it's his second year na. If you notice he doesn't also have his batarangs and all of that. Even the batmobile is just like an upgraded muscle car. Like this movie just gradually sets up that universe and that's why I like it
4/19/22, 9:29 PM - Babila Mutia: ahnnnn

I was also wondering how old he was

because he was also young
4/19/22, 9:29 PM - Babila Mutia: okayy
4/19/22, 9:29 PM - ST: Yes yes. That's why the police also don't really trust him too much in this movie.

5/1/22, 2:47 PM - Babila Mutia: yes I just reached Accra 😹
5/1/22, 2:55 PM - ST: How is the city?
5/1/22, 2:55 PM - ST: 😂😂
5/1/22, 3:11 PM - Babila Mutia: it's just there 😹
5/1/22, 3:11 PM - Babila Mutia: I'm. just at the airport so I dnt really know
5/1/22, 3:11 PM - Babila Mutia: it's also hot
5/1/22, 3:11 PM - Babila Mutia: I actually have to go to a different city in Ghana, so I'm waiting for the next flight
5/1/22, 3:24 PM - ST: Ahh ok😂😂

5/3/22, 1:26 PM - ST: Is that in Ghana?
5/3/22, 1:26 PM - Babila Mutia: Yes..

Its a lake we went to
5/3/22, 1:26 PM - Babila Mutia: I've forgotten the name 😹
5/3/22, 1:27 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂ahh ok
5/3/22, 1:27 PM - ST: Look at how nice it is😂😂
5/3/22, 1:28 PM - Babila Mutia: I'm telling you 😹
not that lake in Yaounde
5/3/22, 1:28 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂that lake is horrible. I'm sure all the fish there have even died 😂😂
5/3/22, 1:30 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
5/3/22, 1:30 PM - Babila Mutia: or they have mutated to survive 😹😹
5/3/22, 1:31 PM - Babila Mutia: The lake here has a story like it's from a Marvel movie like Wakanda
5/3/22, 1:31 PM - Babila Mutia: that it was first à very small lake
5/3/22, 1:31 PM - Babila Mutia: and there were 30 villages around it
5/3/22, 1:31 PM - Babila Mutia: Then it started becoming larger and it swallowed one village every 8 years
5/3/22, 1:31 PM - Babila Mutia: till. it became big like that
5/3/22, 1:32 PM - Babila Mutia: But some places look the same 😹😹😹
5/3/22, 2:10 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂noo
5/3/22, 2:10 PM - ST: It's just a story
5/3/22, 2:10 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
5/3/22, 2:12 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹😹 tsiups
5/3/22, 2:19 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹 nooo
5/3/22, 2:19 PM - Babila Mutia: it's real life 😹
5/3/22, 2:42 PM - ST: 😂😂😂noo the fish did not mutate
5/3/22, 2:45 PM - Babila Mutia: I'm telling you 😹
5/3/22, 2:45 PM - Babila Mutia: and it became sentient 😹
5/3/22, 2:46 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
5/3/22, 7:12 PM - Babila Mutia: in other words we dnt exist 🌚
bc we are 90% empty space, because we are made up. of atoms that are 90% empty space
5/3/22, 7:13 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂😂so in the end how does that even make sense 😂🤦‍♂️
5/3/22, 7:13 PM - ST: It's just terrible
5/3/22, 7:13 PM - Babila Mutia: it's electromagnetic forces and other natural forces like. the strong force and weak force in the nucleus.

But particles are nt always moving.
In space for example, not all partlces are moving
5/3/22, 7:14 PM - ST: But if the universe is constantly expanding doesn't that mean everything is also constantly moving?
5/3/22, 7:14 PM - ST: Because if everything came into existence by a force then that means everything that came into existence came into existence with motion na?
5/3/22, 7:14 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹 yes na
5/3/22, 7:15 PM - ST: No it doesn't 😂
5/3/22, 7:15 PM - Babila Mutia: ahnn. that's true
5/3/22, 7:15 PM - ST: It's just confusing 😂😂🤦‍♂️
5/3/22, 7:15 PM - Babila Mutia: why does it not? 😹
5/3/22, 7:15 PM - ST: Because we exist na
5/3/22, 7:15 PM - Babila Mutia: but it dosant mean everything is moving though 🤔
5/3/22, 7:16 PM - Babila Mutia: it's possible for things to stop. moving
5/3/22, 7:16 PM - Babila Mutia: due to. collisions and other interactions
5/3/22, 7:16 PM - ST: But aren't the atoms in that thing still somehow moving
5/3/22, 7:16 PM - ST: That would mean that that objects isn't at complete rest na or something
5/3/22, 7:17 PM - ST: Or shouldn't there be an amendment to that law to be like "partial rest" or something
5/3/22, 7:17 PM - Babila Mutia: no. no

Einstein clearly explained that motion is relative
5/3/22, 7:17 PM - Babila Mutia: so it doesn't have to be partial
5/3/22, 7:18 PM - Babila Mutia: exactly and their total motion sums to zero
5/3/22, 7:18 PM - ST: Ahhh ok ok I understand
5/3/22, 7:18 PM - ST: Okay I see
5/3/22, 7:18 PM - Babila Mutia: to me it's the confusing is because of English
5/3/22, 7:19 PM - ST: Yes somehow 😂
5/3/22, 7:19 PM - Babila Mutia: if you were just really communicating using the mathematical formulae then it will be alright
5/3/22, 7:19 PM - Babila Mutia: the problem is in English many words are used it multiple contexts so it changes
5/3/22, 7:19 PM - ST: Yes that's true..
5/3/22, 7:19 PM - Babila Mutia: but the maths still makes sense..
5/3/22, 7:20 PM - ST: Yes it does
5/3/22, 7:21 PM - ST: And I even just realized that objects also started moving at the start even though they came into existence at the same time
5/3/22, 7:21 PM - ST: Because there was a force
5/3/22, 7:21 PM - Babila Mutia: Well that's what people think
5/3/22, 7:21 PM - Babila Mutia: it's the big bang theory n'a
5/3/22, 7:21 PM - Babila Mutia: but it's just a theory for now
5/3/22, 7:22 PM - Babila Mutia: it's just because they observed the universe to be expanding so they assume it should have started from somewhere
5/3/22, 7:22 PM - Babila Mutia: the thing is the universe is not expanding from a point
5/3/22, 7:22 PM - Babila Mutia: it's expanding in a special kind of way
5/3/22, 7:22 PM - ST: How?
5/3/22, 7:23 PM - ST: But even if it's not expanding from a point it somehow has a start or something na, because nothing can spring from nothingness
5/3/22, 7:23 PM - Babila Mutia: the distance between EVERY points is getting bigger relative to any other. Not just the distance between all points and a particular point.

You can have a similar expansion of you draw dots on a balloon and blow it.

The points all move further away from. EVERY other point
5/3/22, 7:23 PM - Babila Mutia: yes that's true
5/3/22, 7:24 PM - Babila Mutia: but the big bang hasn't been proven yet
5/3/22, 7:24 PM - ST: Ahhhhhhh ok ok yes
5/3/22, 7:24 PM - Babila Mutia: so its also very strange
5/3/22, 7:24 PM - Babila Mutia: also there many types of infinite universes that people think. exist

depending on the topology
5/3/22, 7:24 PM - Babila Mutia: all these things are just theories...
we dnt really know. for. sure
5/3/22, 7:25 PM - ST: So the expansion isn't umm what's the word, at the same pace
5/3/22, 7:25 PM - ST: There's a mathematical term for this word I've forgotten it.. We use it in sequences and series
5/3/22, 7:25 PM - ST: Ahh yes yes that's true
5/3/22, 7:25 PM - Babila Mutia: Yes...
its nt really expansion

but you can  call it expansions since all distances are getting bigger
5/3/22, 7:26 PM - Babila Mutia: ahnn.. I. did that in French 😹😅😅
5/3/22, 7:26 PM - ST: Yes technically..
5/3/22, 7:26 PM - ST: Is it progressively or something I don't really remember
5/3/22, 7:26 PM - ST: Like the word in English but I have the general idea in maths😂😂
5/3/22, 7:27 PM - Babila Mutia: ahnn 😹😹
5/3/22, 7:27 PM - Babila Mutia: okay okay
5/3/22, 7:28 PM - ST: 🤔🤔hmmm
5/3/22, 7:30 PM - Babila Mutia: for example someone said that imagine the universe to be round, meaning that light goes around. Maybe the light that we see from very far is still from this same point as now but it's light of millions of years ago, so we are. basically looking into the past 😹
5/3/22, 7:30 PM - Babila Mutia: but all these things are still being investigated
5/3/22, 7:30 PM - Babila Mutia: well actually he meant if the observable universe was round
5/3/22, 7:30 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂and the funny thing is that that might actually be true eh
5/3/22, 7:31 PM - Babila Mutia: just type "observable universe" and read the Wikipedia page...
its very interesting 😹
5/3/22, 7:31 PM - Babila Mutia: yes 😹😹😹
5/3/22, 7:31 PM - ST: Okay😂😂
5/3/22, 7:31 PM - Babila Mutia: Because there's only a portion of the universe we can observe
5/3/22, 7:31 PM - Babila Mutia: because of the speed of light and the speed of expansion of the universe
5/3/22, 7:32 PM - ST: I was reading this book called the Kalam cosmological argument. It's a very interesting book about the origin of the universe and on the potentiality of God being the maker of the universe
5/3/22, 7:32 PM - ST: Yes yes I remember you already told me about this
5/3/22, 7:32 PM - ST: It's very interesting. It's where I've been seeing all these theories and different things 😂
5/3/22, 7:32 PM - Babila Mutia: ahnn okay okay
5/3/22, 7:32 PM - Babila Mutia: ahnn 😹
5/4/22, 5:08 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹imagine he just removes a laser and started cutting you?
5/4/22, 5:09 PM - Babila Mutia: I just knew 😹😹
5/4/22, 5:09 PM - ST: They actually had a whole Saber fight in the ref 😂😂
5/4/22, 5:09 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂😂😂

5/4/22, 5:21 PM - ST: No it wasn't the last one na😂😂.. It was the one before the last. The last one was with eren and the collosal titans na😂😂
5/4/22, 5:21 PM - Babila Mutia: ahnn okay okay that's true
5/4/22, 5:22 PM - ST: To me the show should have just ended here 🌚
5/4/22, 5:24 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹no it ended well
5/4/22, 5:24 PM - Babila Mutia: With Eren repeating his words from season 1
5/4/22, 5:25 PM - ST: That's what I'm saying na😂😂 the whole show should have just ended there but apparently there's going to be a part 3
5/4/22, 5:26 PM - Babila Mutia: ahnn
5/4/22, 5:26 PM - Babila Mutia: no. it could nt end there n'a?
5/4/22, 5:26 PM - Babila Mutia: we have to see what happens
5/4/22, 5:27 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
5/4/22, 5:27 PM - ST: Eren should just flatten the world 😂😂
5/4/22, 5:27 PM - ST: And that's the end 😂

5/4/22, 5:30 PM - Babila Mutia: noooo😹😹😹
5/4/22, 5:30 PM - Babila Mutia: but it can be nice if we see it happen 😹😹

5/4/22, 5:31 PM - Babila Mutia: like how thanos won in infinity war
5/4/22, 5:31 PM - ST: Yes like that it will be nice 😂.. And that will be something that no other anime has done or something 🤌
5/4/22, 5:35 PM - Babila Mutia: yes yes 😹🤌🏾🤌🏾
5/5/22, 4:38 PM - ST: Is there an age limit?🌚
5/5/22, 4:59 PM - Babila Mutia: I dnt think so
5/5/22, 4:59 PM - Babila Mutia: Even if, I think you're old enough
5/5/22, 7:18 PM - ST: Ahh ok 🤔
5/5/22, 7:39 PM - Babila Mutia: Uncle Eric did something to you?
5/5/22, 7:49 PM - ST: No no not really.. Its just that I feel very uncomfortable at times in the house. He has some anger issues and always criticizing everything. Anways it has been like that since I came. I've learned to cope with it but sometimes it just gets over the top
5/5/22, 7:49 PM - Babila Mutia: Okay

5/10/22, 10:14 PM - Babila Mutia: where you always had a defender that will shake his chest at the referee then his teammates came and held him 😹😹😹
5/10/22, 10:15 PM - ST: Ahh yes yes 😂😂
5/10/22, 10:15 PM - ST: i think his name was wartera or something na😂😂🔥

5/10/22, 10:16 PM - Babila Mutia: he was always scoring 😹
5/10/22, 10:17 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂 yes yes. I think the name of the game was ISS na or something.. International superstar soccer

that was the name
5/10/22, 10:17 PM - Babila Mutia: I'll look for the game again 😹

5/16/22, 2:07 PM - Babila Mutia: so where will ya marks come from? 😹
5/16/22, 2:10 PM - ST: I already have an A in the course.. Exam is 15% of your grade.. The remaining 75% is from assignments. I presently have am A(94) in English because of assignments.. If I took the test and I did good, it would raise my grade  so I would probably get a 98 or something.. But if I did bad with the exam my grade would probably go down to a B.. But since I have the exemption, I don't need to take it.. So my grade remains on a 94.. Constant
5/16/22, 2:10 PM - Babila Mutia: Ahnnn okay
5/16/22, 2:11 PM - Babila Mutia: they like to complicate school in America 🤦🏾‍♂️

5/16/22, 2:12 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂the only reason I had that exemption was because I did well on the ACT.. On the English exam.. So I don't know if I'll have any other exemption for any other subjects 😂😂

5/20/22, 8:18 AM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹😹
5/20/22, 12:14 PM - ST: What is a neural network 🌚
5/20/22, 12:36 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹 oh oh
5/20/22, 12:36 PM - Babila Mutia: Well there's normal machine learning n'a
5/20/22, 12:37 PM - Babila Mutia: that's uses alot of maths and statistics equations to create algorithms that can learn from data
5/20/22, 12:37 PM - Babila Mutia: But they have their limits
5/20/22, 12:37 PM - Babila Mutia: So. people were inspired by the structure of the brains to create a new type of machine learning algorithm called an artificial neural network
5/20/22, 12:38 PM - Babila Mutia: You know how the brain is. made up of many neurones separated by synapses
5/20/22, 12:39 PM - ST: Ahh ok ok. So is this one mostly used in games or how? Or is it only used for specific programs only?
5/20/22, 12:39 PM - ST: Yes yes
5/20/22, 12:39 PM - Babila Mutia: So they modeled like articifial neurons with links between them and with a process called back propagation the neural networks are able to learn from data
5/20/22, 12:39 PM - Babila Mutia: Well its used anywhere.

That's what Google uses for speech recognition. Also what  Tesla uses for self driving
5/20/22, 12:40 PM - Babila Mutia: And it can also be used for games.
5/20/22, 12:40 PM - Babila Mutia: AlphaZero is a neural network AI that plays chess very well.

And it has a creative style that man Chess GMs have even adapted into their games
5/20/22, 12:41 PM - Babila Mutia: it learnt by just being given the rules and playing against itself many times
5/20/22, 12:42 PM - ST: Ahh ok ok.. So they can keep learning over one specific piece of data or over various pieces? Or does that fall to the person making the algorithm?
5/20/22, 12:42 PM - ST: Ahh ok I see🤔
5/20/22, 12:44 PM - Babila Mutia: Yes they can get better over time with the same data.

But it's nt too good because they might over spexialise

and it will. nt be able to. generalize

Imagine training it. to. recognize faces and it trains only on 1M faces for a long time. It might think anyone's face that's not in. the training set is not an actual face
5/20/22, 12:46 PM - Babila Mutia: So part of the person's job is making sure the data is good and clean

because if the data is not good it will learn the wrong thing

Its abit like these genies that make. a. different wish if you are nt careful about how u frame ur wish 😹
5/20/22, 12:46 PM - Babila Mutia: Her name is also praise? 😹

6/28/22, 7:22 PM - Babila Mutia: Then did not understand the film 🤌🏾🤌🏾
6/28/22, 7:23 PM - Babila Mutia: When they were walking in the other world they had time bc Wanda couldn't follow them immediately. she had to dreamwalk
6/28/22, 7:24 PM - Babila Mutia: And that other part where they were fighting with the illuminati was just fan service
but Wanda can actually kill CPT Marvel and all those pple...

She's extremely strong with the dark hold
6/28/22, 7:25 PM - Babila Mutia: No her goal was not to meet her parents 😹
Her goal was to control her powers 
But the fact that her parents died, was stopping her
6/28/22, 7:26 PM - ST: Okay yes this is understandable na
6/28/22, 7:26 PM - Babila Mutia: No but it's normal that it ddnt feel like his movie. They also did that in Captain America civil War

When that was his movie it felt like Avengers 2.5
6/28/22, 7:27 PM - ST: But this didn't make sense 😂😂.. Reed Richards is the smartest man alive but he had no plan or anything. But captain Carter was still alive... Then captain marvel c got killed by falling rocks while she can burst through thanos spaceship
6/28/22, 7:27 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 7:27 PM - Babila Mutia: America Chaves is different because if her powers

That's why there's only one of her in all the universes
6/28/22, 7:27 PM - ST: She literally said she was looking for them na of something 😂😂
6/28/22, 7:28 PM - ST: Then they should have explained na or clarified 😂
6/28/22, 7:28 PM - Babila Mutia: No that was just fan service 😹

Na to make a scene where she kills all of them fast and also to introduce reed Richards and professor X
6/28/22, 7:28 PM - Babila Mutia: But it's true that they died Abit stupidly 😹
6/28/22, 7:29 PM - ST: Nooo even if it was like an avengers movie, captain America's character arc wasn't overshadowed.. It still somehow felt about him and his character growth
6/28/22, 7:29 PM - Babila Mutia: But she can still beat them in a fight
6/28/22, 7:29 PM - ST: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 7:29 PM - Babila Mutia: And even this one eh

It's that many pple didn't realize it 

If you watch a breakdown of his character in the movie you'll see
6/28/22, 7:29 PM - ST: I've not refused. My point is that their deaths didn't make sense
6/28/22, 7:29 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹
6/28/22, 7:29 PM - Babila Mutia: No that's true 😹
6/28/22, 7:30 PM - Babila Mutia: No it was a nice movie 

It's just that maybe u ddnt expect it
6/28/22, 7:31 PM - ST: Even if... The movie just felt cheesy. It was just a type. Take for example a movie that was so serious like Shang chi.. It had stakes or something. This one was just no stakes nothing. I didn't even feel anything. At a certain point even a main character could die and I wouldn't even blink 🙂
6/28/22, 7:31 PM - Babila Mutia: And what about it Avengers infinity war that was Thanos's film
6/28/22, 7:33 PM - ST: Yes but the other avengers weren't too overshadowed.. And even then we were already familiar with their characters which was why we didn't need too much but Dr stranger's character is inconsistent throughout the mcu so in this movie some choices he made were just bizzar
6/28/22, 7:33 PM - ST: This movie was just a type 🤦🏾‍♂️
6/28/22, 7:34 PM - Babila Mutia: Nooo 😹😹😹

It had stakes
Just that it was a bit personal

Den Strange did not want to allow Chaves to die and allow Wanda to effectively do what she wants with the multiverse
6/28/22, 7:34 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹
6/28/22, 7:34 PM - Babila Mutia: No it was nice
6/28/22, 7:34 PM - Babila Mutia: Just rewatch it normally
6/28/22, 7:34 PM - Babila Mutia: You'll see
6/28/22, 7:34 PM - ST: I've rewatched it like 3 times 😂😂
6/28/22, 7:35 PM - ST: Twice in the theaters and 1 at home 😂😂
6/28/22, 7:35 PM - ST: It was even getting worse 😂😂😂

6/28/22, 7:35 PM - Babila Mutia: It is a nice movie
6/28/22, 7:35 PM - ST: I'm telling you na😂😂
6/28/22, 7:37 PM - Babila Mutia: And it was different enough for the MCU

The only thing they can say is that it felt more like Wanda's movie

But it introduced alot of concepts for the greater MCU

Like incursions, dream walking, the illuminati

6/28/22, 7:42 PM - Babila Mutia: That's what I was saying... It was bc of what you were expecting
6/28/22, 7:43 PM - Babila Mutia: But the movie will have been too long 

Imagine that it was already long like that.

He made it different enough and the horror aspects of the movie
6/28/22, 7:44 PM - ST: But I went to watch no way home with expectations na not all were met but it was still a good movie
6/28/22, 7:44 PM - ST: That's what I'm saying that that whole illuminati part should have been removed
6/28/22, 7:45 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹 but it was not even long na

And it's the illuminati that explained the incursions part
6/28/22, 7:51 PM - ST: They should have explained it somehow else.. The whole illuminati thing wasn't needed... They were just feeding off nostalgia and they didn't even do it well
6/28/22, 7:51 PM - Babila Mutia: Noo it did well 😹

7/8/22, 9:06 AM - Babila Mutia: This is the problem...

Everyone wants something similar to phase 3 with a menacing villains and all that but phase 1 and phase 2 were not like that. Meanwhile phase 4 and phase 5 are all about going back to the status quo while building for the next big conflict in phase 6 or 7. In essence phase 4 is supposed to be like those festival arcs in an anime where everyone is relaxing after the battle tournament arc
7/8/22, 2:11 PM - ST: But they aren't even building anything. And that's the problem. There's nothing being set up
7/8/22, 2:11 PM - ST: With the only exception being Shang chi
7/8/22, 4:21 PM - Babila Mutia: No that's what they want you to think
7/8/22, 4:22 PM - Babila Mutia: You remember how in phase one we just thought they were movies

Then when people started talking about how they were related it felt like a conspiracy theory 😹 then the payoff when it came altogether was great
7/8/22, 4:23 PM - Babila Mutia: It's the same thing now

They are just setting up the foundation in seemingly independent ways that will hopefully payoff later
7/8/22, 4:38 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹😹 okay I'll watch it when it comes in hd 🙁

7/11/22, 5:07 PM - Babila Mutia: They always start well them get terrible after
7/11/22, 5:15 PM - ST: 😂😂😂
7/11/22, 5:19 PM - ST: No no its a Korean manga like God of high school that got adapted.. Its not isekai and it's not a game like sword art online. In that world there are some portals that just suddenly appeared over the globe and those portals were like dungeons or something. The portals allowed people to go from the normal world to the world with monsters and those people became hunters. But the monsters cannot come from the portals to the normal world. The portals vary, like there are different tiers or something like D to S. The story starts with a very weak protagonist who followed his friends to an S dungeon because he thought it was going to be fun or easy😂😂.. The thing is very nice. And so many people have been waiting for an anime adaptation
7/11/22, 5:20 PM - Babila Mutia: Okay 🌚
7/12/22, 12:04 AM - ST: Missed group video call

7/15/22, 12:48 PM - Babila Mutia: He's saying that after 1000 episodes that the real one piece is about to start? 😹
7/15/22, 12:48 PM - Babila Mutia: That's horrible 😹
7/15/22, 12:48 PM - Babila Mutia: So what were all these 1000 episodes
7/15/22, 12:49 PM - Babila Mutia: Even if I want to watch one episode a day it will take me like 3 years to catch up 😹
7/15/22, 12:50 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂😂😂but that's probably how some writers are na. And you could probably skip like the filler episodes. And people have been saying that one piece is good na so he's obviously not done 😂
7/15/22, 12:51 PM - Babila Mutia: Imagine he dies now 😹😹what will happen?
7/15/22, 1:16 PM - ST: But then hes written up to a point which is satisfactory na😂😂
7/15/22, 2:04 PM - Babila Mutia: No because he said one piece is still about to start 😹😹
7/15/22, 2:38 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂maybe it's like attack on titan season 4  na where it's the actual beginning of the show but it's also going to end soon
7/15/22, 2:43 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹 noo Season 4 is not the beginning of the show
7/15/22, 2:44 PM - Babila Mutia: It's just like a different arc starting and that was not after 1000 episodes.

So what were the 1000 previous episodes for?
7/15/22, 3:17 PM - ST: To probably build up something na😂😂
7/15/22, 3:18 PM - ST: It is na. Like since the beginning was just finding out the truth and now that the truth was discovered the series actually now started na🤌😂

7/15/22, 7:03 PM - ST: Ahh ok
7/15/22, 7:04 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹 it's true that there are too many movies
7/15/22, 7:04 PM - Babila Mutia: And sometimes you have to watch the shows to understand other movies
7/15/22, 7:04 PM - Babila Mutia: I think the shoes are just mini movies on other less characters
7/15/22, 7:05 PM - Babila Mutia: Since there's not enough screen time for character development in the growing cast of MCU characters
7/15/22, 7:05 PM - Babila Mutia: If not each movie will be like an avenger movie with 5-10 heroes
7/15/22, 7:06 PM - ST: Yes yes that's true. But sometimes I think that some plots for movies should not be too dependent on the shows because it ruins the experience for some other people. A bit like Multiverse of madness
7/15/22, 7:06 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂
7/15/22, 7:06 PM - ST: Yeah that's true
7/15/22, 7:06 PM - Babila Mutia: <Media omitted>

7/15/22, 7:07 PM - Babila Mutia: 😹😹
7/15/22, 7:09 PM - ST: Ahh ok ok I understand. But then it brings the problem that the comics also introduced where you're just completely confused on what's what or who is who. Because for comic fans it's easy to watch all these things but for new people now that's a bit of an issue. But yes I understand what you're saying

7/26/22, 5:26 PM - Babila Mutia: It's extremely amazing how possible it is to write an essay with the absence of the fifth vowel in the English alphabet...

My brother didn't believe me when I said I could do it. Regardless, here I am, writing a whole long text and I haven't needed the vowel even once.

8/2/22, 9:44 PM - ST: Oh oh😂😂😂
8/3/22, 8:21 AM - Babila Mutia: Nooo I prefer the first trilogy
8/3/22, 8:22 AM - Babila Mutia: It's true he was more of a detective in this one but it ddnt really have that Batman feel
8/3/22, 8:22 AM - Babila Mutia: Especially in the action side of things
8/3/22, 8:23 AM - Babila Mutia: And Batman never actually figured out any of his plans...

He was just moving from place to place... Even the last one of the flood was because of that police officer that new about carpets
8/3/22, 8:23 AM - Babila Mutia: Then he ddnt use many gadgets
8/3/22, 8:24 AM - Babila Mutia: It's was a nice movie but it ddnt feel too much like Batman 👌🏾
8/3/22, 9:43 AM - Babila Mutia: <Media omitted>
8/3/22, 2:00 PM - ST: But it was because this was still his first year na. He was still getting used to everything. His first batarang was on his chest. And he doesn't really have too many gadgets. I know the dark knight and the other ones were good, but as an origin story it's nice seeing batman have a character arc and all of that instead of just a movie carried by the villain. Then of course he made a lot of mistakes since he's still young. And the action here is way better than the first trilogy. So I actually liked it.. Even tho it wasn't too much. Maybe by the second movie it'll get better
8/3/22, 2:00 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂😂tsuips
8/3/22, 2:01 PM - ST: The scouts on bikes😂😂😂😂
8/3/22, 2:03 PM - Babila Mutia: The villain wasn't even really that interesting
8/3/22, 2:04 PM - Babila Mutia: Why was he the riddler?
8/3/22, 2:04 PM - Babila Mutia: He was just giving questions and was abit crazy
8/3/22, 2:05 PM - Babila Mutia: When I started watching the beginning I thought that we would see a very dangerous batman or something 🤌🏾
8/3/22, 2:05 PM - Babila Mutia: It was a nice film...

To me there's no film that has really gotten Batman well...
8/3/22, 2:05 PM - Babila Mutia: Then there was no aspect to Bruce Wayen
8/3/22, 2:05 PM - Babila Mutia: Meanwhile Bruce Wayne is also a very important aspect of Batman
8/3/22, 2:06 PM - Babila Mutia: Bruce Wayne here was just flat.
8/3/22, 2:19 PM - ST: But that's because he doesn't really care about any of Bruce Wayne na which is important to his character arc too. Maybe next movie he'll realize the importance of Bruce Wayne. Because normally batman doesn't really even spend too much time as Bruce wayne and puts it up as a front so that people don't believe he's batman. But I understand the complaint. It's true his character left more to be desired. But as so far as it serves as a narrative and actually has purpose for me it's actually fine. Then for the riddler, his motivations were actually really well explained. He was an orphan who was taken advantage of and broken by the city na, so he sought to take down all the corrupt people in power but not like batman. By his own way by killing them. And since batman had been ruling the city with fear and vengeance he thought they were the same. Or something.. It really adds to his character... And Most of the questions he was actually giving were to help unmask all the corruption in Gotham.. And to me there wasn't even anything Bruce Wayne could have offered in this movie.. Gotham is so corrupt that the money would have just vanished 😂.. People like carmine Falcone would have taken all of it. Then you also come to realize that the Bruce Wayne persona being absent is also what caused the orphanage from stopping from being funded or also corruption which created the riddler. So Bruce realizes by the end of the movie that what's needed for the city is a hero not vengeance.. Or also Bruce Wayne to help people or something.. To give hope.. Are you seeing 😂😂🤌.. The movie is a really good movie if you break it down and understand everything
8/3/22, 2:22 PM - Babila Mutia: It's a good movie, but it's not like it's the perfect Batman movie or something
8/3/22, 2:22 PM - Babila Mutia: It's just okay

9/19/22, 10:53 AM - Babila Mutia: People are mad 😹
9/19/22, 10:56 AM - Babila Mutia: Let's take that your example I'll write in pseudocode:

String myString = "3";

for i=1; i <= 4; i++ {
  myString = myString + "+3";
}
9/19/22, 10:56 AM - Babila Mutia: That will give you 3+3+3+3
9/19/22, 10:56 AM - Babila Mutia: Sorry it should be i < 4
9/19/22, 11:20 AM - Babila Mutia: Please for the link to the GTA s6 footage
9/19/22, 1:32 PM - ST: https://youtu.be/uP5P508KLYE
9/19/22, 1:32 PM - ST: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
9/19/22, 1:33 PM - ST: Yes yes  for some reason I was thinking of doing a for loop. And I only thought of one when I got up this morning 😂😂
9/19/22, 1:35 PM - ST: But this only adds three na. My answer wants to be based on user input. And the user could enter any number to multiply. Not necessarily "3". Which is where my problem stems from. As I said I was thinking a for loop as the best course of action but not knowing where to go from there 😂
9/19/22, 1:44 PM - Babila Mutia: That's just an example.
9/19/22, 1:44 PM - Babila Mutia: Replace "3" with the variable that takes the first number
9/19/22, 1:45 PM - Babila Mutia: You know about splitting strings?
9/19/22, 1:46 PM - Babila Mutia: If let's say you split the string: "I am a boy"

By default it breaks into an array of strings broken by space. To give ["I", "am", "a", "boy"]
9/19/22, 1:47 PM - Babila Mutia: But you can specify what you want to split by instead of space.

For example you can use "x"

So if the user enters "3x4" and you split by "x" you can have the array ["3", "4"]
9/19/22, 1:48 PM - Babila Mutia: From there you can convert the second element to a number that you will use in your for loop (where I used 4)

And the first number is what you will use everywhere I used 3 in the example.
9/19/22, 1:48 PM - ST: No not really 🤔
9/19/22, 1:49 PM - Babila Mutia: Ahnn okay

All programming languages have it.

Just check how to do Java.

9/20/22, 6:56 PM - Babila Mutia: Instead add all the strings to a variable in the loop. And write at the end
9/20/22, 7:18 PM - Babila Mutia: So you can write instead

string addString = "( a";

for (count = 0; count < b; count++) {
  addString = addString + " + a";
}

addString = ")";

Console.Writeline("Therefore"+ a+"x" +b+"= adding" + addString) ;
